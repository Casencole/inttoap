# Name
I Need to Think of a Pun (Inttoap) 
* Working Title

# Goal
I am not really sure what my goal is but I would love to use view or edit some
sort of spread sheet in via the terminal as google sheets is probably my most
used website. 

To start I would like to run the program on any csv, tsv, etc and have a 
decently formated output in the terminal (Just viewing no editing)
