# Goal
**VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS**
This is mostly a thinking out loud of what I need/want to do

I am not really sure what my goal is but I would love to use view or edit some
sort of spread sheet in via the terminal as google sheets is probably my most
used website. 

To start I would like to run the program on any csv, tsv, etc and have a 
decently formatted output in the terminal (Just viewing no editing)

To continue I likely need to make/pick a data structure to hold the cell text...
